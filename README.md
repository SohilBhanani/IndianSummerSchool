Programs for nodeMCU 8266 and arduino uno are provided here.
NodeMCU was created shortly after the ESP8266 came out. 
On December 30, 2013, Espressif Systems began production of the ESP8266.
The ESP8266 is a Wi-Fi SoC integrated with a Tensilica Xtensa LX106 core,
widely used in IoT applications (see related projects). NodeMCU started on 13 Oct 2014,
when Hong committed the first file of nodemcu-firmware to GitHub.
